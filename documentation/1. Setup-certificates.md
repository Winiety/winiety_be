1. Create `certs` catalog in app root - "winiety_be"
2. Download `mkcert` from https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases
3. Rename downloaded file to `mkcert` and move it to `certs` catalog
4. Run command `.\mkcert -install` (it will create two files rootCA-key.pem and rootCA.pem)

!ACHTUNG!
Files rootCA-key.pem and rootCA.pem should not be exported or shared with anyone.
They are only for development purposes and should be used on end users computers.
